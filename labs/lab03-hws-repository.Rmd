## 1 Directory for Stat 133

The first thing you'll have to do is to create a directory for the course.
I recommend using the name `stat133` but you can choose a different title.
The location of this directory is entirely up to you (e.g. your home directory,
your Desktop, or your Dropbox folder, for instance).

- Open the terminal (bash or gitbash)
- Optional: change directory to your preferred location
- Create a directory for Stat 133
```bash
mkdir stat133
```
- Change directory to `stat133`
```bash
cd stat133
```


## 2 Cloning the Assignments Repository

Once you created a directory for Stat 133, the next step involves cloning 
(i.e. copying) the `stat133-hws-fall17` repository from GitHub.
First, make sure you are inside `stat133` (or the name that you chose);
you can check your working directory with `pwd`
```
pwd
```

Assuming that you are inside the directory `stat133`, now you can clone 
`stat133-hws-fall17` with the following git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-hws-fall17.git
```

It's possible that you encounter some error message, e.g. Mac users may get a 
message related with a missing component for `CommandLineTools`. If this your 
case, then type in the terminal console:

```bash
# Mac users may need to run this command
xcode-select --install
```

The command `git clone ...` will download and create your own copy of the template
repository. This is the repository that you will be using to upload ALL your
assignments: warm-up assignments, HW assignments, and posts.

_Note_: If you have followed the previous instructions, you should be fine. But just 
in case, here's a brief important notice. Please, do NOT fork the repository
`stat133-hws-fall17`. Forking and Cloning are two different things.


## 3 Customizing the `README.md` file

Now that you have your own repository `stat133-hws-fall17`, you need to 
customize some of the contents of the `README.md` file.

- Change directory to your assignments repo:
```bash
cd stat133-hws-fall17
```
- List the contents
```bash
ls
```
- You should be able to see a file `README.md`
- Open `README.md` with your favorite text editor (e.g. you can open it 
from RStudio if you are not sure what text editor to use).
- At the very top of the `README.md` you will find the following four fields:

```
- Student name: First Last
- Github username: usrname
- Lab section: 101
- GSI: Leia Organa
```
- Change the default content with your own information:
    + your first and last names
    + your github username
    + your lab section
    + the name of your section's GSI
- Save the changes made in `README.md`.
- So far the content in `README.md` has been updated, but these changes have
not been recorded by Git. You can confirm this by checking the status of the repo:
```bash
git status
```
- Notice that Git knows that `README.md` has changed, but the changes have not
been staged.
- Let's add the changes in `README.md` so that Git can record them in its database:
```bash
git add README.md
```
- As it is customary, after adding changes, you check the status of your
repository (You should see a git message telling you about the 
_"Changes to be committed"_):
```
git status
```
- Now let's commit those changes, including a [commit message](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages):
```
git commit -m "readme: customize with personal information"
```


## 4 Adding your own remote repository

- Right now you have a (local) git repository in your computer. 
- Because you cloned the repo from Github, your local repository is linked
to the remote `https://github.com/ucb-stat133/stat133-hws-fall17`
(but this remote is not really part of your github repositories).
- So let's remove the current remote repository:
```bash
git remote rm origin
```
- In order to have your own github repo, you need to first create a repository
in your github account.
- Go to your Github account and look for the icon-button with the `+` sign 
(at the top of the page), which is the button to _Create new repository_.
- Click the option _Create new repository_.
- Name your repository: `stat133-hws-fall17`
- Click on the green button `Create repository` at the bottom of the page 
(don't change any of the default options).

Now you have the local repository (with the content of the template), as well as
the empty github repository. The next step is to link (or connect) your local
repo with the one that you just created in github. Follow these steps:

To add a remote repository use the command below __with your own username__:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/stat133-hws-fall17.git
```
- Verify your new remote
```bash
git remote -v
```
- If everything is OK, you should be able to see a message 
(with your own username) like this:
```
# Verify new remote
origin  https://github.com/username/stat133-hws-fall17.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/username/stat133-hws-fall17.git (push)
```


## 5 Pushing `README.md` to GitHub

- Now that you have linked your local repo with your remote repo, you can 
start pushing (i.e. uploading) commits to github.
- As part of the basic workflow with git and github, you want to constantly 
check the status of your repo"
```
git status
```
- Now let's push your recent commit to the remote branch (`origin`) from
the local branch (`master`):
```bash
git push origin master
```
- Go to your Github repository and refresh the browser. If everything went fine, 
you should be able to see the contents of your customized `README.md` file.


## 6 Pushing Warm-Up 01 assignment

- As you can tell, you have a folder (i.e. directory) `warmup01` in your local repo. This folder contains its own `README.md` file.
- Somewhere in your computer you should have the `.Rmd` file of your first warm-up assignment: it should be named `up01-first-last.Rmd` where `first` and `last` are your first and last names.
- Copy your `up01-first-last.Rmd` file to the directory `warmup01`. 
- Open `up01-first-last.Rmd` (e.g. open it with RStudio).
- In the yaml header of `up01-first-last.Rmd`, change the __output__ field from `html_document` to `github_document`.
- Knit the file; the output file should be a markdown file with `.md`
extension (e.g. `up01-first-last.md`).
- In the terminal, make sure you are inside the directory `warmup01`.
- Check the status of the repo:
```bash
git status
```
- Let's add the source `.Rmd` file, and the knitted `.md` file; 
remember to use your _first_ and _last_ names:
```
git add up01-first-last.Rmd up01-first-last.md
```
- Check the status again (so you get into this habit):
```bash
git status
```
- Commit the added modifications, and include a message:
```bash
git commit -m "warmup01: generate github document"
```
- Now, let's push the committed changes to the remote repo in github:
```bash
git push origin master
```
- Go to your github repo, and check the contents of the folder 
`warmup01`, you should be able to see the `.Rmd` and `.md` files.
- Take a look at the `.md` file, it should be rendered nicely by 
github.


## 7 Pushing Warm-Up 02 assignment

- Follow the previous instructions to push your second warm-up assignment to Github.
- Copy `up02-first-last.Rmd` to the directory `warmup02`
- Open `up02-first-last.Rmd` and change the yaml __output__ field as: 
`github_document`
- Knit the file to get an `.md` document
- Make sure you are inside the directory `warmup02`.
- Add and commit the`README.md` file, the source `.Rmd`, and the `.md` file; 
remember to use your _first_ and _last_ names:
```bash
git status
git add README.md up02-first-last.Rmd up02-first-last.md
git status
git commit -m "warmup02: generate github document"
```
- Push the committed changes to your remote repo:
```bash
git push origin master
```
- Go to your github repo, and check the contents of the folder 
`warmup02`, you should be able to see the `.Rmd` and `.md` files.
- Take a look at the `.md` file, it should be rendered nicely by 
github.


## 8 Make your repository private

- Right now your github `stat133-hws-fall17` repository is public, and everybody 
can see its contents.
- To reduce the temptation of students taking a peek at other classmates'
repositories, we are going to ask you to make your repo private.
- Go to your github repository, and locate the __Settings__ tab in the manu bar 
(at the top). Click on __Settings__.
- Scroll down until you see the __Danger Zone__.
- Select the option __Make this repository private__.
- Go to __Settings__ again, but now click on the __Collaborators & teams__ (in the left sidebar).
- You will have to add the instructor and your GSI as collaborators. 
Here's the list of staff usernames:
    + Instructor: `gastonstat`
    + Xiaoqi: `xz0416`
    + Minchul: `mshin03`
    + Omid: `osolari`
    + Andy: `supermao10`
    + Ningning: `ningning1992`
- Please keep your repository in private mode until the semester is over (Dec-18th).
- I don't recommend deleting your repo after the semester is over. Why not? Because it is your work, and you will put many hours of effort on it. And I bet you will eventually come back to check its content to see how something was done (data reshaping, a plot, a function, slides, a shiny app, etc).
- Keep your repo as part of your (code) portfolio.
