Post 1 - Stat 133, Fall 2017
================

**Due date:** Tuesday Oct-31, 2017 (before midnight)

The purpose of this assignment is to write a report, in the form of a blog post, about one or more topics covered so far in the course.

Guidelines
----------

You can talk about any of the things that we've covered so far in the first six weeks of the course. Or you could also choose a topic you are very interested in, but that hasn't been covered yet.

Regardless of your chosen topic(s), you should write beyond the extent of what was covered in lecture/labs. For example, if you decide to talk about vectors, don't just simply regurgitate the notions of atomicity, coercion, vectorization, recycling, and subscripting with bracket notation. Instead, show an interesting example(s) in which you describe your audience the application of such notions.

Likewise, you should do some research, and include at least seven references. These could be data sets, posts, videos, books, articles, websites, etc.

More important, you must write content using your own words. We want to see that you not only read about a topic, but that you are also able to summarize keypoints, and comprehend the main concepts; expressing interpretations, descriptions and conclusions from your own perspective.

Take this assignment as an opportunity to:

-   learn more about something that has caught your attention.
-   know more about those things that you don't quite understand.
-   review and reflect on what you've learned so far.

Especially for those of you who this is the first time using command-based software, analyzing (wragling, reshaping, exploring) data, and working with (toy) projects in which you are more aware of the file-structure, you could write a post summarizing your learning experience in the last weeks.

Submission
----------

-   You must push the files of your post assignment to your `stat133-hws-fall17` github repository.

-   Create a folder `post01` and put everything there.

-   You have total freedom to determine the file structure of `post01`.

-   Write your post using an `Rmd` file, and knit it in both `md` and `html` versions. Both versions should be pushed to your repo.

-   You will also have to submit your `html` file to bCourses.

Keep Mastery in mind ...
------------------------

The post assignments have an underlying goal of being *mastery oriented* tasks, as opposed to *performance oriented goals*. Here's a pdf by [Mark Girod](http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/vita.html) that compares both types of goals: **[Mastery vs Performance](../papers/mastery_vs_performance_goals.pdf)**

Specs
-----

Here's a list of general specifications:

-   **Introduction**: Write a clear and captivating introduction that grabs the reader's attention. And describe the purpose of the post.

-   **Organize the content**: Organize the content of your blog in different sections: e.g. motivation, background, examples, discussion, conclusions, and references.

-   **Images**: Include some images like pictures, diagrams, plots, drawings.

-   **Code**: Also include code snippets (e.g. code chunks) showing examples, clearly commented, nicely formatted.

-   **Take-home message**: Make sure to include a summarizing statement of the content in your post. If the reader had to remember one major thing from your post, what would that be?

-   **Length**: How long should your post be? There is not really a unique answer for this question. It depends on what you decide to write about. Try writing a post no shorter than 1,000 words, and preferably no longer than 5,000 words (these values are just a recommendation).

-   **Audience**: Think of your audience as other Stat 133 students, or students interested in data analysis but with (almost) no experience in this area. BTW: the instructor is NOT your audience.

-   **Style**: Write the content as a post. In other words, this is NOT an academic paper. You can actually use some slang, and express ideas in the same way you would verbally explain things to a classmate.

-   **Be respectful**: Pretend that your post is public and thus could be read by ANYONE. So don't write things (or use language) you wouldn't like your future boss, or recruiters, to read about. Follow this rule of thumb: don't write things that you could later regret.

Peer Grading
------------

-   Your post will be peer-graded. This means that two of your lab-mates will read the content, and greade your work following a provided rubric.

-   We will randomly assign peer reviewers. Failing to peer review will negatively affect the reviewer's grade.

-   The course staff will review your post and the peer-grades, and determine the final score.

-   More instructions on the reviewing process will be posted on bCourses.

Rubric
------

Here's the rubric that peer graders will be using to assess a post. The reviewer is expected to enter scores for every graded aspect on a simple coarse scale (0, 0.5, and 1 points).

As a reviewer, please take some time to thoroughly read the posts you were assigned to review. This means that you may need to read a post at least twice. Read it first from begining to end, and then a second time in which you evaluate the aspects of the rubric.

As a reviewer, you should test any code or examples to check whether you can obtain the same results. Likewise, check any provided references in order to make sure that they are valid: e.g. a you tube video really exists, a website or post is active, a stackoverflow Q/A is legit.

Last but not least: please keep in mind the diversity of student backgrounds in Stat 133: students intending majoring in stats, applied math, computer science, biology, chemistry, economics, political sciences, environmental sciences, etc. It is possible that someone has decided to write about a topic that you are completely ignorant about. If that's the case, focus on the rubric aspects as objectively as possible.
